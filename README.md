Financial Data (GDP, Stock Market, &amp; Cryptocurrency) Analysis

In this project, I explore economic indicators and cryptocurrency trends through data wrangling, analysis, and visualization. In the first part, I uncover key insights by analyzing the GDP, VXX and VTI tickers. In the second part, I focus on cryptocurrency data, applying similar techniques to highlight patterns and trends. The final report (PDF file) includes supporting visuals to illustrate my findings.
